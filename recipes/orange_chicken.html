    <h4>Directions: <h4>
    <ol>
    <h5><li>Gather all ingredients.</li><h5>
    <h5><li>Whisk together flour, cornstarch, salt, and white pepper in a large bowl.<br> 
         Add egg, water, and 1 1/2 tablespoons oil and stir to combine (mixture will be like a sticky batter).<br>
         Add chicken pieces to batter and toss well to coat. Let chicken stand in refrigerator while oil heats.</li><h5>
    <h5><li>Pour oil into a deep saucepan filled about 2 inches deep. Heat oil to 375 degrees C (190 degrees F). 

        Meanwhile, for the sauce heat remaining oil and 2 teaspoons sesame oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.<br>
        Add crushed red pepper, ginger, and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.<br>
        Stir in brown sugar, orange juice, vinegar, and soy sauce and bring mixture to a boil, stirring often. </li><h5>

    <h5><li>Combine 3 tablespoons cold water with cornstarch in a small bowl and stir until cornstarch is dissolved.<br>
        Pour mixture into saucepan and stir to combine.<br>
        Bring mixture to a boil and reduce to simmer, stirring constantly until sauce thickens.<br>
        Turn heat off and keep warm while chicken is cooking.</li><h5>

    <h5><li>Working in batches, add coated chicken pieces carefully to the hot oil. 
        Oil temperature will reduce when food is added. Cook chicken at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), stirring occasionally, until golden brown and crispy, 5 to 6 minutes.<br>
        Remove chicken with a slotted spoon and drain on a wire rack set over paper towels.<br>
        Bring oil temperature back up to 365 to 375 degrees F (185 to 190 degrees C) and repeat process with remaining chicken.</li><h5>

    <h5><li>Return sauce mixture to medium heat, add more water if necessary if sauce thickens too much.<br>
        Once hot, add in cooked chicken pieces and toss well to coat.<br>
        Stir in remaining sesame oil and orange zest and serve over hot cooked rice.<br>
        Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds if desired.</li><h5>
